A Twitter video/GIF extractor extension for Chrome!

It is not currently published to the Chrome Web Store, so installation may be a bit more of a pain than I'd like - however I may get it published eventually (:

### How to install

1. Download the latest build zip from the [**releases page**]()
2. Extract the zip folder wherever you would like to store Twitdown
3. Open Chrome's extensions tab
4. Enable developer mode
5. Click load unpacked and select Twitdown's folder
6. **(optional)** Pin Twitdown to your search bar for convenience

### How to use

1. Go to a tweet, for example [**this one**](https://twitter.com/spazzaneve17/status/1437837908011016192)
2. Click the extension icon, and a URL to the mp4 will open in a new tab!
3. Right click the video, and save as.
